# Study Group Overview: Designing Multi-Agent Systems

## Resources

- [Book Summary (Part Summaries)](multi-agent-systems-summary.md)
- [12-Week Study Plan](study-plan.md)

## Purpose

Learn how to design multi-agent systems that are reliable, testable, and maintainable, with a focus on practical patterns and real trade-offs.

For the detailed weekly agenda and reading notes, start with the links above.

## What We’ll Learn

Core themes:

- **System design for agents**: roles, responsibilities, handoffs, and orchestration patterns
- **Tool use + memory**: integrating tools, state, and context strategies
- **Quality + safety**: evaluation, observability, guardrails, and failure modes
- **Production trade-offs**: cost, latency, privacy/security, operational constraints

## Who It’s For (All Disciplines)

Anyone building or shipping agentic systems, across disciplines:

- Engineering, data science, product/UX, technical program management, security/compliance

## How We Work

Each session aims to produce a small artifact (diagram, checklist, workflow spec), with mixed-experience participation.

Typical session format:

- Quick recap (so people can join even if behind)
- Small-group exercise (produce an artifact)
- Share-outs + open questions

## Outcomes

By the end, participants should have:

- Shared vocabulary for agents, tools, memory, orchestration, and evaluation
- A set of reusable artifacts (rubrics/checklists/workflow specs)
- Better judgment on trade-offs (cost, safety, UX, reliability)

## Participation

- Be respectful and curious; optimize for shared learning.
- Share examples that are safe to discuss (no sensitive data).
