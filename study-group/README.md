# Study Group Overview: Designing Multi-Agent Systems

## Resources

- [Book Summary (Part Summaries)](multi-agent-systems-summary.md)
- [12-Week Study Plan](study-plan.md)

## Purpose

This study group exists to help participants **learn how to design multi-agent systems**—not just how to call an LLM API, but how to architect agentic workflows that are reliable, testable, and maintainable.

A second core goal is **exposure and collaboration with individuals in other dev crews**. Multi-agent systems are inherently cross-functional: effective solutions require coordination across product, engineering, data, and operations. This group is designed to create a lightweight space where people from different teams can learn together, compare approaches, and share real constraints from their day-to-day work.

## What We’ll Learn

We focus on practical patterns and engineering fundamentals for multi-agent systems, including:

- **System design for agents**: roles, responsibilities, handoffs, and orchestration patterns
- **Planning and decomposition**: when and how agents should break problems down
- **Tool use**: integrating agents with APIs, codebases, data stores, and automation
- **Coordination and routing**: multi-agent collaboration, delegation, and task distribution
- **Memory and context**: retrieval, summarization, state management, and context strategy
- **Quality and safety**: evaluation, testing, guardrails, failure modes, and observability
- **Production considerations**: cost, latency, privacy/security, and operational robustness

The aim is to build shared intuition for when multi-agent systems are a good fit—and how to design them responsibly.

## Who It’s For (All Disciplines)

This group is intentionally designed to include participants from **all disciplines**. It should be valuable across roles, including:

- **Engineering roles**: architecture, tool integration, reliability, testing, and deployment
- **Data science roles**: evaluation methods, retrieval, data pipelines, measurement, and iteration
- **Technical program management roles**: coordinating cross-team implementation, risks, milestones, and decision-making

If your work touches product delivery, systems design, automation, analytics, or platform reliability, you’ll have relevant context to contribute.

## How We Work

We aim to keep the format consistent and collaborative:

- **Short readings / examples**: small, focused materials that illustrate a pattern
- **Hands-on discussion**: compare designs, trade-offs, and real-world constraints
- **Lightweight exercises**: sketch a workflow, define agent roles, or critique an architecture
- **Cross-crew sharing**: rotate perspectives so teams can learn from each other’s practices

## Outcomes

By participating, you should come away with:

- A shared vocabulary for agent and multi-agent design
- Practical patterns you can apply to real projects
- Better judgment around trade-offs, failure modes, and measurement
- Stronger collaboration across dev crews and disciplines

## Participation Expectations

- Bring curiosity and a willingness to share what’s worked (and what hasn’t).
- Ask clarifying questions—multi-agent design benefits from diverse perspectives.
- Keep examples safe and appropriate for sharing (no sensitive data).
