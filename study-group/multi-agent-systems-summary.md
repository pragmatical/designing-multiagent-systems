# Designing Multi-Agent Systems — Part Summaries

This document provides concise, part-level summaries of the book **"Designing Multi-Agent Systems"** by Victor Dibia, organized around its four major parts: foundations, building from scratch, evaluation & responsible AI, and real-world applications.

## Part I — Foundations of Multi-Agent Systems

Part I establishes the conceptual groundwork for understanding agents and multi-agent systems before touching any implementation.

### Scope and Goals

- Define what an **agent** is (reason, act, communicate, adapt) and how it is built from a model, tools, and memory.
- Explain **why and when** to use *multi-agent* architectures instead of a single model or single agent.
- Introduce a **taxonomy of orchestration patterns** and the **UX principles** required to make multi-agent systems usable and trustworthy.

### Key Themes

1. **From Models → Agents → Multi-Agent Systems**
   - Simple tasks (e.g., factual Q&A) can be solved with direct model calls.
   - More complex tasks (planning, tool use, live data) require *agents* that can call tools, maintain state, and iterate.
   - Tasks combining planning, diverse expertise, extensive context, and adaptive solutions are best served by *multiple agents* coordinating.

2. **Multi-Agent Orchestration Patterns**
   - **Workflow patterns** (explicit control): sequential, conditional, parallel workflows where the developer defines the graph.
   - **Autonomous patterns** (emergent control): plan-based, handoff, and conversation-driven (group chat) orchestration where agents or orchestrators decide at runtime.
   - Emphasis on **pattern selection**: choosing the simplest pattern that meets task needs.

3. **UX Principles for Multi-Agent Systems**
   - Shift from *interface design* (clicking buttons) to *delegation design* (natural-language task delegation to autonomous systems).
   - Four core UX principles:
     - **Capability discovery**: help users understand what the system can reliably do.
     - **Cost-aware action delegation**: communicate consequence / risk level of actions and when human approval is required.
     - **Observability & provenance**: expose what agents did, with which tools and data.
     - **Interruptibility**: allow users to pause, resume, or cancel long-running agent tasks.
   - Differentiate between **end-user** needs (functional transparency) and **developer** needs (coordination transparency, debugging, evaluation).

### Outcome

Part I gives you a vocabulary and decision framework for deciding *if* you need agents, *why* you might need multiple agents, and *how* to think about patterns and UX before writing code.

## Part II — Building Multi-Agent Systems from Scratch

Part II moves from concepts to implementation. It builds a small but complete Python library, **picoagents**, that embodies the architectural ideas from Part I.

### Scope and Goals

- Implement an **async-first Agent abstraction**: `Agent(model, tools, memory)`.
- Add capabilities for **tools, memory, middleware, cancellation, streaming, and computer use**.
- Build **workflow** and **autonomous orchestration** layers on top of individual agents.
- Expose agents through **modern web UIs** and discuss how to evaluate and choose frameworks.

### Key Themes

1. **Agent Construction (Chapter 4)**
   - Define a **BaseAgent** and concrete `Agent` with:
     - A model client (chat-completion style LLM abstraction).
     - Tools (wrapped via `BaseTool` / `FunctionTool`).
     - Memory (short-term via message history, long-term via RAG-like interfaces).
   - Implement the **agent execution loop** (prepare context → call model → handle tool calls → iterate → return).
   - Support **streaming** events, **cancellation tokens**, and **structured output** using Pydantic models.

2. **Computer Use Agents (Chapter 5)**
   - Extend agents to operate existing UIs when APIs are not available.
   - Decompose into **OBSERVE–THINK–ACT** loops:
     - Interface representation (text, image, or hybrid).
     - Action space and action executor (e.g., Playwright, UI drivers).
   - Discuss reliability, grounding, latency, and security concerns.

3. **Workflow Construction (Chapter 6)**
   - Represent workflows as **computational graphs** with steps and edges.
   - Implement sequential, conditional, and parallel execution, plus checkpointing and persistence.
   - Enable **type-safe steps**, validation, and restart from checkpoints.

4. **Autonomous Orchestration (Chapter 7)**
   - Implement orchestrators:
     - **Round-robin** orchestrator.
     - **AI-driven** orchestrator (LLM selects next agent).
     - **Plan-based** orchestrator (plans, assigns work, evaluates progress, retries).
   - Provide **termination conditions** (max messages, semantic criteria, composites).

5. **Modern Web Experiences (Chapter 8)**
   - Separate **backend** (FastAPI + SSE, async agents) and **frontend** (vanilla JS / React).
   - Implement UX principles in a **web UI**: real-time streaming, capability discovery, interrupt controls, debug panels.

6. **Multi-Agent Frameworks (Chapter 9)**
   - Identify ten core capabilities for production frameworks (DX, async, observability, state, configuration, guardrails, extensibility, deployment, evals, ecosystem).
   - Provide criteria for evaluating when picoagents-style “from scratch” is enough versus when to adopt a larger framework.

### Outcome

Part II leaves you with a concrete, working implementation of agents, workflows, orchestrators, and a web UI. It gives you an internal model for *how* frameworks are built, improving your ability to design, debug, or select one for production.

## Part III — Evaluation, Optimization, and Responsible AI

Part III focuses on making multi-agent systems **reliable, measurable, and responsible**. It treats evaluation and optimization as first-class engineering activities and introduces distributed protocols and ethics.

### Scope and Goals

- Define how to **evaluate** multi-agent trajectories and entire systems.
- Show how to **optimize** systems by treating failure modes as optimization opportunities.
- Introduce **protocols** (MCP, A2A) for distributed agents.
- Frame **ethics and security** in an agentic context.

### Key Themes

1. **Evaluating Multi-Agent Systems (Chapter 10)**
   - Represent complete runs as **trajectories** (messages, tool calls, results) and evaluate at that level.
   - Build **evaluation suites** and harnesses:
     - Reference-based vs reference-free metrics.
     - LLM-as-a-judge for open-ended tasks.
   - Design task suites, configure judges, run evaluations, and analyze results.

2. **Optimizing Multi-Agent Systems (Chapter 11)**
   - Treat common failure modes as a checklist for optimization, including:
     - Underspecified instructions.
     - Wrong model choice or mismatch between prompt and model.
     - Poor tooling, lack of memory, missing metacognition.
     - Wrong orchestration pattern, lack of evals, or missing human delegation.
   - Emphasize empirical iteration: change one factor at a time and measure impact.

3. **Protocols for Distributed Agents (Chapter 12)**
   - Cover **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for tool and context integration with agentic capabilities (sessions, tools, prompts, security).
   - Cover **Agent-to-Agent (A2A)** protocols for task-centric cross-boundary agent collaboration.
   - Compare protocol capabilities and discuss when to choose which.

4. **Ethics and Responsible AI (Chapter 13)**
   - Contrast **traditional AI ethics** with **agentic ethics** where agents can act in the world.
   - Analyze societal-scale issues:
     - Agentic noise, platform imbalance.
     - Occupational disruption, responsibility diffusion.
     - Emergent risks from autonomous behavior and action capabilities.
   - Discuss security paradigm shifts (traditional boundaries break when agents have tools) and propose middleware-based defenses and ethical deployment checklists.

### Outcome

Part III gives you methods and tools to *measure*, *improve*, and *govern* multi-agent systems. It moves you from “it works sometimes” to “we know how well it works, why, and how to improve it safely.”

## Part IV — Real-World Applications

Part IV demonstrates how the concepts, patterns, and infrastructure from earlier parts apply to **end-to-end real systems**.

### Scope and Goals

- Show full-stack, multi-agent implementations for two important domains:
  - Answering business questions from unstructured data.
  - Building a software engineering agent.
- Illustrate how to combine workflows, tools, memory, orchestration, and UX into production-like solutions.

### Key Themes

1. **Answering Business Questions from Unstructured Data (Chapter 14)**
   - Model the task as a **workflow**:
     1. Data loading with intelligent caching.
     2. Cost-effective pre-filtering.
     3. Structured LLM analysis.
     4. Insight generation and visualization.
   - Implement robust testing: test each component independently, then validate end-to-end.
   - Analyze results, understand limitations, and suggest optimizations.

2. **Building a Software Engineering Agent (Chapter 15)**
   - Design tools for a coding agent: file operations, code execution, memory, meta-cognitive tools.
   - Emphasize **prompt engineering** for agents: workflow structure, memory-first patterns, progress tracking, completion criteria, and error-handling guidance.
   - Implement a complete example (e.g., a calculator module) and walk through what happens internally.
   - Discuss practical constraints: iteration limits, timeouts, workspace isolation, cost management.

### Outcome

Part IV operationalizes the book’s ideas in concrete domains. It shows how to go from “building blocks” to **end-to-end applications** that you can adapt to your own scenarios (analytics agents, productivity agents, dev agents, etc.).
